To install dependencies:

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.1. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Dev Containers in VS Code

Because Bun doesn't install on windows, this is designed to be run in a devcontainer.

Use the command `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

## Running the app

In the terminal, type `bun run index.ts --watch`
